            <p>
              VR Chat has become a very popular way of communicating with many
              different communites; especially during these tough times. But
              when chatting online you must be careful of who you may be talking
              to. Make sure they have a valid username and listen for signs of a
              voice changer software.

              likely has a database where its all saved.

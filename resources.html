            Threats to children’s internet safety include invasions of privacy, cyberbullying, sexting and harassment. Options 
            to protect your children include parental controls, apps and tracking software. But the most effective way to keep your 
            kids safe is to talk with them about online risks, how to avoid them and how they can come to you when something goes 
            wrong.

            If you thought it was tough to keep kids off the internet before COVID-19, it’s almost impossible now. Between 
            mandated online school and playdates via video chat, chances are you and your kids are spending a lot more time 
            online in quarantine than ever before. For some, it may be the first time you’ve explored this new frontier with your little one.

            Children today are growing up with technology, not growing into it like previous generations. So we’re working

            family.

            Kids should talk with a trusted adult so they understand online risks, only chat with people they know, ensure 
            their online accounts are private, block people they don’t know or trust, and trust their instinct—if something 
            makes them feel uncomfortable, tell a trusted adult about it.

            The opportunities kids have to socialize online come with benefits and risks. Adults can help reduce the risks by 
            talking to kids about making safe and responsible decisions.
